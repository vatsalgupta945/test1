# AI Prompts & Workflow Log

This document records the exact prompts and workflow instructions used across all development sessions of this project from initial project inception, master prompt generation, feature implementations, and testing to cloud deployment and debugging.

---

##Prompt Group 0A: Initial Planning

Goal: Understand the assignment properly before starting development and decide the next steps.

**Prompt:**

«I have been given this purchase-requisition system as a take-home assignment. Before writing any code, first go through the requirements and help me understand what needs to be built.

Make an implementation plan and point out anything that is unclear, any assumptions we need to make, and possible edge cases that I should take care of.

I am planning to use Supabase for the database and authentication, Lovable for the frontend, and Antigravity for the backend. I want the application to be reasonably fast and simple without adding unnecessary things.

For now, don't write the actual code. First tell me how we should approach the project, what should be done first, what needs to be decided, and what the frontend will need from the backend.

Once the plan is clear, tell me what my next steps should be to start building the application.»

## Prompt Group 0B: Generated Master Frontend Prompt (for Lovable)
**Goal**: Specialized generation prompt specifying full frontend UI requirements, Supabase auth integration, role routing, and API integration.

**Prompt**:
> Build a React (Vite + Tailwind) frontend for a purchase-requisition system. Two roles: "requester" and "approver" — after login, route each role to a different default view and hide actions the role isn't allowed to take (the backend also enforces this, but the UI shouldn't offer buttons that will 403).
> 
> AUTH: use @supabase/supabase-js against these env vars: VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY. Sign-up/login via Supabase Auth email+password. After a successful sign-up, call POST {VITE_API_BASE_URL}/profiles once to create the backend-side profile row (new sign-ups are always role "requester"; approver accounts are seeded separately and just log in). Attach the Supabase session's access token as "Authorization: Bearer <token>" on every call to VITE_API_BASE_URL.
> 
> PAGES:
> 1. Login / Signup — plain email+password forms via Supabase Auth.
> 2. Dashboard (landing page after login) — calls GET /dashboard and shows: headline numbers (awaiting_approval, open_commitments_value, overdue_count, received_last_7_days), a breakdown by status, a breakdown by department, and a bar/line chart of received_per_week (8 weeks). Show an alerts badge in the nav using GET /alerts's "count" (approvers only).
> 3. Requisitions list — searchable/filterable/sortable/paginated table backed entirely by GET /requisitions query params: search, status, department, owner_id, overdue, assigned_to_me, sort_by, sort_dir, page, page_size. Do not filter client-side — always re-query the server when a filter changes. Requesters only ever see their own; approvers can toggle between "full queue" (status=Submitted) and "assigned to me" (assigned_to_me=true).
> 4. Requisition detail page — shows the requisition, its line items (editable only while status is Draft and the viewer is the owner), computed total, is_overdue flag, the assigned-approvers panel, the append-only timeline (GET /requisitions/:id/timeline), and a comment box (POST /requisitions/:id/comments — comments cannot be edited/deleted, don't build UI for that). Show role- and status-appropriate action buttons:
>    - Owner + Draft: edit fields/lines, Submit, Archive.
>    - Approver + Submitted: Approve, Reject (reason required, non-empty).
>    - Approver + Approved: Mark Ordered.
>    - Approver + Ordered: Record Receipt (per line, capped at remaining quantity in the UI, but always let the server be the final word), Extend Needed-By Date.
>    - Any + any status: Archive / Restore.
> 5. New Requisition form (requester only) — title, vendor_name, department, needed_by, then an inline line-item editor (description, ordered_quantity, unit_price) before Submit is enabled. Disable Submit until at least one line item exists.
> 6. Approval queue page (approver only) — the Submitted list with row checkboxes and a "Bulk Approve" button calling POST /requisitions/bulk-approve; after the call, show a per-row result (approved vs refused-with-reason) from the response — do not assume a batch either fully succeeds or fully fails.
> 7. Export button on the requisitions list (approver only) — hits GET /requisitions/export/open-commitments and downloads the returned CSV.
> 
> API BASE: {VITE_API_BASE_URL}/api. All endpoints require the bearer token except signup/login (handled by Supabase directly). Full contract:
>   GET  /me
>   POST /profiles                                    body: {}
>   POST /requisitions                                 body: {title, vendor_name, department, needed_by}
>   GET  /requisitions?search=&status=&department=&owner_id=&overdue=&assigned_to_me=&sort_by=&sort_dir=&page=&page_size= -> {data:[...], total, page, page_size}
>   GET  /requisitions/:id                             -> requisition + line_items + total + is_overdue
>   PATCH /requisitions/:id                            body: any of {title, vendor_name, department, needed_by} (owner, Draft only)
>   PATCH /requisitions/:id/needed-by                  body: {needed_by} (approver, Ordered only)
>   POST /requisitions/:id/submit
>   POST /requisitions/:id/archive
>   POST /requisitions/:id/restore
>   POST /requisitions/:id/approve                     -> 200 or 409 {error:{code:"LIMIT_EXCEEDED"}}
>   POST /requisitions/:id/reject                      body: {reason}
>   POST /requisitions/:id/order
>   POST /requisitions/:id/receipts                    body: {receipts:[{line_item_id, quantity_received}]}
>   POST /requisitions/bulk-approve                    body: {requisition_ids:[...]} -> {results:[{id,status,reason?}]}
>   GET  /requisitions/export/open-commitments         -> CSV file
>   POST /requisitions/:id/line-items                  body: {description, ordered_quantity, unit_price}
>   PATCH /requisitions/:id/line-items/:lineId
>   DELETE /requisitions/:id/line-items/:lineId
>   GET  /requisitions/:id/approvers                   -> [{approver_id, email, assigned_at}]
>   POST /requisitions/:id/approvers                   body: {approver_id}
>   DELETE /requisitions/:id/approvers/:approverId
>   GET  /requisitions/:id/timeline                    -> ordered history rows
>   POST /requisitions/:id/comments                    body: {body}
>   GET  /alerts                                       -> {data:[...], count}
>   POST /alerts/:requisitionId/dismiss
>   GET  /dashboard                                    -> {awaiting_approval, open_commitments_value, overdue_count, received_last_7_days, by_status, by_department, received_per_week}
> 
> Every error response is {error:{code, message}}; surface `message` to the user in a toast/inline alert rather than a generic "something went wrong."
> 
> Keep it fast and minimal: no extra state-management library (React context is enough for auth + role), no UI kit beyond Tailwind + whatever Lovable already ships, and use `recharts` (or an equivalent already available) only for the dashboard charts.

## Prompt Group 0C: Generated Master Backend Prompt (for Antigravity)
**Goal**: Build the backend according to the assignment requirements and the plan decided during the initial planning stage.

**Prompt**:
> -Now start working on the backend part of the purchase-requisition application based on the requirements and plan we discussed.
Use Node.js, TypeScript and Express, with PostgreSQL on Supabase. Supabase Auth will be used for authentication, and the backend should verify the logged-in user's identity and permissions.
The backend needs to handle the main functionality from the assignment, including creating and managing requisitions, line items, approvals, rejection, receiving, alerts, comments, timeline/history, archiving, dashboard data, searching/filtering, and CSV export.
Make sure the important business rules are enforced on the backend and not only on the frontend. For example, users should not be able to perform actions that their role or the requisition status doesn't allow.
Keep the API consistent with the requirements so that the frontend can use it easily. Also handle errors properly and return useful error messages to the frontend.
Add tests for the important business rules and edge cases, especially approval limits, receiving, role-based access, status changes, and other cases that we identify while building.
Keep the code simple and maintainable and don't add unnecessary dependencies. You can decide the appropriate project structure and modules based on the requirements.
After implementing each major part, explain what was done and mention anything I should check or test before we move forward.
---

## Prompt Group 2: Overdue Alert Dismissal & Reappearance Logic
**Goal**: Implement overdue receipt alert detection and dismissal logic that respects needed-by date changes.

**Prompt**:
> Implement GET /alerts and POST /alerts/:requisitionId/dismiss for approvers. Requirement: If an approver dismisses an alert, but the needed-by date is later extended and then passes again before receiving is complete, the alert MUST reappear.

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Initial Flaw**: The first iteration attempted to add a simple boolean flag `is_dismissed` on the junction table.
- **Correction**: Replaced boolean flag with snapshotting `dismissed_needed_by` in table `alert_dismissals`. When checking active alerts, the query checks `ad.dismissed_needed_by = r.needed_by`. If the date is changed and passes again, the snapshot no longer matches, allowing the alert to reappear cleanly without manual status resets.

---

## Prompt Group 3: Test Suite Generation & Boundary Cases
**Goal**: Create Jest unit tests and Supertest integration tests covering business rules.

**Prompt**:
> Write Jest unit tests for approvals limit boundary (at-limit vs 1 cent over limit), receiving (partial vs completion vs over-receiving rejection), and Supertest integration tests for role-based access control.

**Output Evaluation**:
- Successfully generated unit test assertions covering limit checks (`1000.00` limit vs `1000.01` requisition total), rejection reason validation, line receipt completion, and role enforcement (401/403 HTTP status codes).

---

## Prompt Group 4: Multi-Tier Approver Hierarchy & Monthly Limit Budgeting
**Goal**: Implement company/departmental approver hierarchy with senior vs junior limits, monthly spending tracking, automatic monthly resets, and senior escalation workflows.

**Prompt**:
> in the application create multiple approvers ,and also create company or deparmental heiracy with senior limit greater than junior ,and if a junior isnt able to approve the request goes to senior ,heirachacy ,and also the limit should be monthly that if some amount he approves that amount should be deduted from the limit ,and the limit will be reset every month

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Design Decisions**:
  1. `profiles` schema updated with `reports_to_id`, `department`, `title`, and `monthly_approval_limit`.
  2. Multi-tier approver seeds: Junior Approver ($1k/mo), Senior Operations Director ($50k/mo), Executive VP of Procurement ($500k/mo).
  3. **Zero-Maintenance Monthly Reset**: Spent monthly amount is computed via SQL `DATE_TRUNC('month', h.created_at) = DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)`, ensuring budget automatically resets to $0 on the 1st of every month without requiring brittle cron tasks.
  4. **Senior Escalation Flow**: Added endpoint `POST /api/requisitions/:id/escalate` and a 1-click UI action button for Junior Approvers to escalate requisitions exceeding their limit to their senior manager.

---

## Prompt Group 5: Rejection Reason Visibility & Requester Identity Display
**Goal**: Ensure rejected orders display explicit `Rejected` status, show approver's rejection reason, show the rejecting approver's name/title, show requester identity across the app, and allow requester revision and re-submission.

**Prompt**:
> in the requester side if his order is getting rejected ,show him his order status as rejected with a proper reason given by the approver ,and also show the approver who requested him the request ,show requester name ,and also edit the docs while making changes regarding all prompts i am using

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Refinement**:
  1. Requisition status transitions to `Rejected` when rejected by an approver.
  2. SQL queries for `listRequisitionsHandler` and `getRequisitionByIdHandler` updated to return `rejection_reason`, `rejected_by_email`, `rejected_by_title`, `owner_title`, `owner_department`, and `owner_email`.
  3. Requester side displays a highlighted Rejection Card with the exact reason and the rejecting approver's details.
  4. Enabled draft/rejected editing and a 1-click **"Re-submit for approval"** flow for requesters to revise and re-submit rejected orders.
  5. Added Requester identity column to all table views and detail panels.

---

## Prompt Group 6: Automatic Live Search & Debounced Filtering
**Goal**: Make search and filter inputs filter results automatically in real-time while typing, while retaining manual search buttons and clear filter actions.

**Prompt**:
> okay in searching ,in bar when i am writing any filter its not automatically giving me results ,make it automatic ,keep the search button but also make it automatic

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Implementation**:
  1. Added debounced `useEffect` hooks (250ms) for `searchInput` (Title / Vendor) and `deptInput` (Department).
  2. Maintained the manual "Search" button and `form onSubmit` to allow immediate Enter key or button-click submission.
  3. Added an explicit "Clear filters" action button when any search/filter query is active.

---

## Prompt Group 7: Partial & Case-Insensitive Search Across Requisitions and Departments
**Goal**: Ensure all search and department filter queries use partial matching and case-insensitivity (e.g. typing `EX` or `ex` matches `exyz` or `Operations`).

**Prompt**:
> but you have made it on full word matching i mean if partial is also matching show it ,like i want to search for department exyz,and i write ex then it should show exyz ,and also make it case insensitive ,like if i write EXYZ  or EX it should show exyz

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Implementation**:
  1. Updated SQL queries in `listRequisitionsHandler` to use `r.department ILIKE '%...%'` instead of exact equality `=`.
  2. Broadened search keyword filter across Title, Vendor Name, Department, Requester Email, and Requester Title with `ILIKE '%...%'`.
  3. Joined `profiles` table in `countSql` to ensure consistent total pagination counts.

---

## Prompt Group 8: Multi-Department Hierarchical Database Seeding
**Goal**: Populate database with a comprehensive organizational structure of requesters and approvers across 5 departments while maintaining hierarchical reporting chains and monthly spending caps.

**Prompt**:
> okay in the database add many entries for requesters and approvers while maintaining heirachy

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Implementation**:
  1. Seeded 18 profiles across 5 distinct departments:
     - **Executive / Finance**: CFO ($1,000,000/mo) and Executive VP of Procurement ($500,000/mo).
     - **Engineering**: VP of Engineering ($100,000/mo) -> Engineering Manager ($20,000/mo) -> Junior Approver ($1,000/mo) -> Senior Systems Engineer & QA Automation Lead (Requesters).
     - **Operations**: Senior Operations Director ($50,000/mo) -> Operations Floor Manager ($15,000/mo) -> Logistics Lead & Supply Chain Analyst (Requesters).
     - **Safety & Facilities**: Director of Safety & EHS ($35,000/mo) -> Site Safety Supervisor ($5,000/mo) -> Senior Maintenance Tech & Facilities Specialist (Requesters).
     - **IT & Cloud**: Director of IT Systems ($75,000/mo) -> Cloud Infrastructure Approver ($8,000/mo) -> Cloud DevOps Engineer (Requester).
  2. Seeded 11 requisitions across all departments in various lifecycle statuses (`Draft`, `Submitted`, `Approved`, `Rejected`, `Ordered`, `Received`) with line items and historical audit records.
  3. Added quick demo login buttons grouped by hierarchy and department on the sign-in page.

---

## Prompt Group 9: Archiving & Unarchiving (Restore) Workflow
**Goal**: Ensure archived requisitions can be retrieved, filtered, inspected, and unarchived (restored) back to active queues seamlessly.

**Prompt**:
> check for the archieved thing like if i am putting some requisition on archive ,how will i fetch it back from archive ,if i want to see archived requisitions

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Implementation**:
  1. **Backend List Query**: Added support to filter archived records when selecting status `Archived`.
  2. **Detail Page Actions**: Added `Restore` action button (`POST /api/requisitions/:id/restore`) and `Archive` button (`POST /api/requisitions/:id/archive`).

---

## Prompt Group 10: User-Scoped / Independent Per-User Archiving
**Goal**: Ensure archiving is personal and user-specific: when a requester archives a request, it only hides from their own workspace, while remaining active for approvers, and vice versa.

**Prompt (Audio)**:
> I mean when I am talking about archive, like for example if a requester has archived his request, then archive must happen at requester's side, not at approver's side. And for example if an approver has archived a requisition, then the approver should be able to see his archived requisition, not the requester who has requested it. Whoever archives the request or requisition should only see the archive list, not the other end person.

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Design Decisions & Architecture**:
  1. **New Junction Table**: Created `user_archived_requisitions (user_id, requisition_id, archived_at, PRIMARY KEY (user_id, requisition_id))` to decouple archiving from a global column to an independent per-user state.
  2. **Per-User Scoped Querying**:
     - `GET /api/requisitions`: Filters `NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM user_archived_requisitions WHERE user_id = current_user)` for active queues, and `EXISTS (...)` when viewing `Archived` status.
     - `GET /api/requisitions/:id`: Returns `is_archived: Boolean` specific to the authenticated user.
  3. **Multi-User Isolation Verified**:
     - When Requester archives an order, it is archived and hidden only from their view; Approver still sees it active in their approval queue.
     - When Approver archives an order, it is archived and hidden only from their queue; Requester still sees it active in their dashboard.

---

## Prompt Group 11: Production Deployment Configuration (Render + Vercel)
**Goal**: Configure, verify, and document full-stack production deployment of the Express backend to Render and TanStack Start frontend to Vercel with live URLs, environment variables, health checks, and cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).

**Prompt (Audio)**:
> Okay, now I have to deploy it. So how will I deploy it using Render and Vercel? I want to make this application now live running with a link. So tell me the procedure and also make the changes in the ai-prompts.md regarding all the prompts I am giving to you.

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Implementation & Verification**:
  1. **Backend Production Preparation**:
     - Verified build script `npm run build` (`tsc`) producing valid `dist/server.js`.
     - Added root `/` and `/health` endpoints in `app.ts` so Render's health monitoring returns HTTP 200 immediately.
     - Confirmed dynamic PORT binding (`process.env.PORT || 5000`) and CORS compatibility.
  3. **Deployment Documentation & Runbook**:
     - Step-by-step instructions for Render web service setup (GitHub repo `purchase-hub`).
     - Step-by-step instructions for Vercel project setup (GitHub repo `approve-flow-61`).
     - Clear environment variable mapping for live connectivity.

---

## Prompt Group 12: Monorepo Consolidation & Unified Repository
**Goal**: Consolidate frontend and backend codebases into a single unified GitHub repository for unified tracking and deployment.

**Prompt**:
> push frontend and backend in a single repository ,there are two different repo for frontend and backend

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Implementation & Structure**:
  1. Consolidated root workspace into a structured monorepo containing `assignment-backend/` and `frontend/approve-flow-61/`.
  2. Initialized top-level Git repository configured with `.gitignore` covering `node_modules`, build artifacts (`dist`, `.output`), and temporary logs.
  3. Linked root repository to `https://github.com/vatsalgupta945/purchase-hub.git`.
---

## Prompt Group 13: Render Monorepo ENOENT Build Error Fix
**Goal**: Resolve missing `package.json` build failure during initial deployment on Render.

**Prompt**:
> npm error code ENOENT
> npm error syscall open
> npm error path /opt/render/project/src/package.json
> npm error errno -2
> npm error enoent Could not read package.json: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/opt/render/project/src/package.json'
> npm error enoent This is related to npm not being able to find a file.

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Diagnosis**: Render by default executes build commands from the root of the repository (`/opt/render/project/src/`), but the project is structured as a monorepo with `assignment-backend/` and `frontend/approve-flow-61/`.
- **Solution**: Instructed the user to set the **Root Directory** field in Render's Service Settings to `assignment-backend` and configured the build/start commands accordingly.

---

## Prompt Group 14: Dual-Platform Hosting Strategy (Render + Vercel)
**Goal**: Provide exact, comprehensive deployment instructions tailored for Express backend on Render and TanStack Start / Vite frontend on Vercel.

**Prompt**:
> i am deploying this backend in render and frontend in vercel

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Implementation**:
  1. Provided a complete step-by-step runbook for Render Web Service (Root Directory: `assignment-backend`, Build: `npm install && npm run migrate && npm run seed && npm run build`, Start: `npm start`).
  2. Provided step-by-step setup for Vercel (Root Directory: `frontend/approve-flow-61`, Build: `npm run build`, Output: `.output/public` or `dist`).
  3. Mapped all required environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).

---

## Prompt Group 15: Frontend "Failed to Fetch" & Network Diagnostics
**Goal**: Diagnose and fix network fetch failures occurring when loading data on the live Vercel application.

**Prompt**:
> on the live application it is showing failed to fetch
> the frontend is showing but data not showing llike for records saying failed to fetch

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Diagnosis**:
  1. In Vite applications, `import.meta.env` values are baked into static JavaScript bundles at compile time. Adding `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in Vercel after initial build required a manual **Redeploy**.
  2. If `VITE_API_BASE_URL` had a trailing slash (e.g. `...com/`) or `/api`, it produced malformed URLs like `//api` or `/api/api`.
- **Solution**:
  1. Updated `frontend/approve-flow-61/src/lib/api.ts` to sanitize `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, automatically stripping trailing slashes and ensuring clean `/api` prefixing.
  2. Provided DevTools (F12 Network tab) diagnostic checklist for inspecting request URLs, mixed content warnings, and HTTP status codes.

---

## Prompt Group 16: CORS Preflight & Infrastructure 404 Resolution
**Goal**: Eliminate browser CORS preflight blocking errors when Vercel frontend communicates with Render backend.

**Prompt**:
> Access to fetch at 'https://test1-3-4zmi.onrender.com/api/me' from origin 'https://test1-nine-delta-36.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Diagnosis**:
  1. Render was returning HTTP 404 for the entire domain because the service was created as a "Static Site" rather than a "Web Service", or the previous build had failed.
  2. When hosting infrastructure returns a 404/502 error page, it omits CORS headers, triggering browser preflight blocks.
- **Solution**:
  1. Upgraded `assignment-backend/src/app.ts` with explicit origin reflection (`origin: true`), allowed headers (`Authorization`, `Content-Type`), credentials, and preflight wildcard handler `app.options('*', cors())`.
  2. Guided user through creating a proper Web Service on Render with database migration & seeding scripts.

---

## Prompt Group 17: Localhost Dual-Server Environment Execution
**Goal**: Launch both the Express backend and React frontend concurrently on localhost for local testing.

**Prompt**:
> run app local host

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Implementation**:
  1. Started backend development daemon (`npm run dev`) on `http://localhost:5000`.
  2. Started frontend development daemon (`npm run dev`) on `http://localhost:8080`.
  3. Verified health check endpoint (`/health`) and supplied quick-login demo credentials.

---

## Prompt Group 18: TypeScript TS5108 Deprecated moduleResolution Removal
**Goal**: Resolve TypeScript compiler build failure on Render caused by newer TypeScript versions deprecating `node10`.

**Prompt**:
> tsconfig.json(5,25): error TS5108: Option 'moduleResolution=node10' has been removed. Please remove it from your configuration.
> this error is coming in render deployment

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Diagnosis**: Newer TypeScript releases deprecated and removed `moduleResolution=node` (alias for `node10`).
- **Solution**: Removed `"moduleResolution": "node"` from `assignment-backend/tsconfig.json` because `"module": "commonjs"` automatically defaults to standard CommonJS resolution. Verified clean compilation with `tsc` and committed fix (`ff5baf3`).

---

## Prompt Group 19: Missing TypeScript Types in Production Builds (TS7016 / TS2591)
**Goal**: Resolve missing type definitions during production cloud builds on Render.

**Prompt**:
> src/app.ts(1,21): error TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'express'...
> src/config/index.ts(6,18): error TS2591: Cannot find name 'process'. Do you need to install type definitions for node?...
> ==> Build failed 😞

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Diagnosis**: Setting `NODE_ENV=production` causes `npm install` to skip `devDependencies`. Because `@types/node`, `@types/express`, `@types/cors`, and `typescript` were in `devDependencies`, `tsc` failed to find type declarations.
- **Solution**: Moved all `@types/*` packages, `ts-node`, and `typescript` into `dependencies` in `assignment-backend/package.json` so cloud production builds always install them. Verified build locally and pushed commit `30c5012`.

---

## Prompt Group 20: Comprehensive Architecture, Implementation & Prompt Documentation
**Goal**: Document the complete system architecture, technical choices, challenge resolutions, and full prompt history in the project documentation.

**Prompt**:
> okay the project is running give me the implementation plan of how this project got implemented ,various challenges you and i faced ,and architecture ,tech stack that was used ,and why
> OKAY and also document whatever prompts i have used with you in ai prompts ,till deployement process and live site ,include all prompts even of previous sessions

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Implementation**:
  1. Compiled exhaustive architecture and implementation summary covering decoupled frontend/backend design, PostgreSQL transactional guarantees, and tech stack rationale.
  2. Updated `docs/ai-prompts.md` with complete chronological records of all 20 prompt groups across planning, business logic, hierarchical approvals, user-scoped archiving, live cloud deployment, and compiler debugging.

---

## Prompt Group 21: Business Rule Fixes (Dashboard Approvals, Timeline Status Changes, Multi-Status Overdue Alerts & Created-by Sorting)
**Goal**: Address 4 specific business logic and UI requirements:
1. Align the Dashboard "Awaiting Approval" counter with the Approver Queue by properly accounting for per-user archiving.
2. In the requisition detail History Timeline, display explicit status transitions (e.g. "Status changed to REJECTED", "Status changed to APPROVED") with badges and rejection reasons instead of generic "Status changed" text.
3. Activate overdue alerts across `Submitted`, `Approved`, and `Ordered` statuses when the requisition's `needed_by` date has passed today, keeping overdue records accessible in the alert icon and re-triggering if the extended date passes again.
4. Fix and enable sorting order for "Created-by / Creation Date" in requisition table views.

**Prompt (Audio)**:
> Hello, okay so now you have to do some changes in the file. For example, first thing in the dashboard it is, make it sure for every approver it shows the correct awaiting requests, awaiting approvals. For example even if there are 3 awaiting approvals, sometimes it's showing 2 awaiting approvals. So make sure the total number of awaiting approval per approver is same as the awaiting approval shown in the dashboard. Second is the status change problem in the history timeline. In the history timeline, you are writing it as 'Status Changed' when any status of the requisition is getting changed. For example if a requisition status is getting changed to 'APPROVED', it is saying that status changed. And for example if a status is getting rejected, it's saying status change. Make sure you put the correct status there. For example if the status is changed to REJECTED, it should show at that particular time the status has been changed to REJECTED, not just status changed. Third is the overdue alert is not working. The overdue alert should be start working in the alert bar for all the requisitions for all the approvers that are overdue. And the overdue should start at SUBMITTED. It should be start at SUBMITTED, APPROVED, and ORDERED. For all three it should show the alert for requisitions that are overdue. The requisitions that have been overdue should be shown in the alert icon. And if the requisition is again overdue even after extending the date, then also it show overdue for SUBMITTED, APPROVED, and ORDERED. And the next thing is that the sorting order is wrong for created by date. Check the sorting order, it is not sorting properly for the created by date. So make these changes in the file, and don't push them on GitHub. First do local run, then change on GitHub if it's working properly.

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Implementation**:
  1. **Dashboard Awaiting Approval Count**: Updated `getDashboardHandler` (`assignment-backend/src/modules/dashboard/index.ts`) to join `user_archived_requisitions` specifically for the current approver, ensuring the awaiting approval count precisely matches the approver's active queue.
  2. **Explicit Timeline Status Messages**: Updated `TimelineItem` in `frontend/approve-flow-61/src/routes/requisitions.$id.tsx` to inspect `meta.old_status` and `meta.new_status` (and parse status transitions from action descriptions), displaying explicit labels such as *"Status changed to REJECTED"* or *"Status changed to APPROVED"* with color-coded status badges and approver rejection reasons.
  3. **Multi-Status Overdue Alerts**: Updated SQL queries in `assignment-backend/src/modules/alerts/index.ts`, `requisitions/index.ts`, and `dashboard/index.ts` so requisitions in `Submitted`, `Approved`, or `Ordered` status with `needed_by < CURRENT_DATE` are flagged as overdue. Overdue dismissals snapshot `needed_by` so extended dates that lapse again automatically re-trigger the alert.
  4. **Created-by Sorting**: Added `created_at` / `created_by` column mapping to `sort_by` in `assignment-backend/src/modules/requisitions/index.ts` and wired sort controls into the frontend requisitions table.

## Prompt Group 23: Overdue Alert Icon Record Retention & Open Commitments Calculation Fix
**Goal**: Refine overdue alert dismissal UX and correct the Open Commitments metric:
1. When dismissing an overdue alert from the top pop-up banner, only remove the banner pop-up for the session, while keeping the full record of all overdue requisitions visible in the Alert Bell icon dropdown. Ensure that if `needed_by` is extended and lapses again without receiving, the overdue pop-up re-triggers.
2. In the Dashboard, verify and correct the Open Commitments calculation to accurately reflect outstanding unfulfilled financial commitments.

**Prompt**:
> 1.for overdue alert icon you are removing the overdue requestion in alert icon  when i am pressing dismiss ,then the alert should go for that session ,but the overdue requistions should appear if i press alert icon ,they shouldnt vanish from overdue alert icon they should still be there just the pop up from my screen should stop showing when i press dismiss for a particular requisition,but record of overdue requests should be present in overdue alert icon,and also make sure that if i extend the needed by date for a overdue reqution ,if it hasnt still been received after new extended date then it should show overdue again
> 
> 2.in the dashboard ,check functionality of open commitments and correct it

**Output Evaluation**:
- **Implementation**:
  1. **Alert Icon Record Retention & Pop-up Dismissal**:
     - Updated `listAlertsHandler` (`assignment-backend/src/modules/alerts/index.ts`) to return all overdue requisitions with an `is_dismissed: boolean` flag indicating whether the approver dismissed the on-screen banner for that `needed_by` snapshot.
     - Updated `AppShell.tsx`: The top `OverdueAlertBar` only displays un-dismissed items (`is_dismissed === false`), while the Bell icon `AlertsPopover` displays the complete persistent list of all overdue items with direct links to the requisition detail page.
  2. **Dashboard Open Commitments Calculation**:
     - Corrected `openCommitmentsSql` in `assignment-backend/src/modules/dashboard/index.ts` to compute the exact outstanding unreceived dollar amount: $\sum (\text{ordered\_quantity} - \text{received\_quantity}) \times \text{unit\_price}$ for unfulfilled line items across active `Approved` and `Ordered` requisitions (excluding Drafts, Submitted, Rejected, fully Received, and user-archived requests).
